## Technicalities

This app was made in Dart using the Flutter SDK (ver. >=2.12.0). At the moment, however, it is only tailored to Android devices, though we do plan on releasing a proper iOS version soon.

The entire list of dependencies is defined in `pubspec.yaml`. Some main dependencies include...

- firebase_auth (ver. 3.3.4)
- cloud_firestore (ver. 3.1.5)
- provider (ver. 6.0.0)
- hexcolor (ver. 2.0.5)
- flutter_spinkit (ver. 5.1.0)
- flutter_phoenix (ver. 1.0.0)
