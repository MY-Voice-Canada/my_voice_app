## Technicalities

This app was made in Dart using the Flutter SDK (ver. >=2.12.0). However, it is currently only tailored to Android devices, though we do plan on releasing a proper iOS version soon.

The entire list of dependencies is defined in `pubspec.yaml`; some of the dependencies stated include

- css_colors (ver. )
- url_launcher (ver. )
